# skrItemScore

This is a really naive WoW addon that will calculate an item's weighted score based on your current class and spec. It adds this score to item tooltips for ease of access. It literally does nothing more than this. It is currently only set to handle Fire Mage scores. I'll add the other class and spec combos as time goes on.

## Caching

The addon does store calculations locally in a local database. I'll eventually add a way to wipe your local database (if you change scores, if Blizzard changes things, etc...).
